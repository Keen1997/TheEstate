                The word estate is colloquially used to refer to the all of the land and improvements 
                on a very large property, often some sort of farm or homestead, or the historic home of a prominent family. 
                However, in the financial and legal sense of the term, an estate refers to everything of value that an individual owns 
                – real estate, art collections, antique items, investments, insurance and any other assets and entitlements – 
                and is also used as an overarching way to refer to a person's net worth. Legally, a person's estate refers to 
                an individual's total assets, minus any liabilities.
